        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-800">
            <p class="mb-6">Hi, I'm Ken. I'm not a plumber. Or an electrician. Or a roofer.<br>
            But I know how frustrating it is when technology gets in the way of your real work.</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-8">That's why I started Gentoolink Web Services — to take the tech headaches <strong>off your plate</strong>, so you can focus on doing what you do best: serving your customers and getting the job done.</blockquote>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-10 mb-4">Why Trades?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Over the years, I've worked with a lot of businesses. But tradespeople?<br>
            You're the backbone of every community. You don't have time to mess around with websites, Google Business listings, or chasing leads online.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">You need simple solutions that actually work.<br>
            Not more apps. Not more "DIY" platforms.<br>
            You just want the phone to ring and your business to be easy to find.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">That's where I come in.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-10 mb-4">What I Do (In Plain English)</h2>
            <ul class="mb-8">
                <li><strong>I build simple, professional websites</strong> that make you look good and bring in calls.</li>
                <li><strong>I make sure your Google Business profile is dialed in</strong> so locals find you first.</li>
                <li><strong>I set up AI tools</strong> that answer missed calls, text customers back, and keep you in front of people.</li>
                <li><strong>I handle the tech stuff</strong> so you don't have to.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-8">No complicated jargon. No call centers. You deal with me, directly.</blockquote>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-10 mb-4">Local Business Helping Local Businesses</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">I'm based right here in Northern BC.<br>
            I know what it's like running a small business in a small town.<br>
            I'm not some big city agency. I'm your neighbor who happens to know a lot about websites, SEO, and automation.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">If you've been meaning to "get around to" fixing up your website or getting your Google listing sorted — that's what I'm here for.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-10 mb-4">Let's Keep It Simple</h2>
            <ul class="mb-8 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>If your phone isn't ringing as much as it should be…</li>
                <li>If you're tired of missing calls while you're on the job…</li>
                <li>If you want someone to just "take care of it"…</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-8">That's what I do.</blockquote>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-10 mb-4">A Bit About Me</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Before I started Gentoolink, I served 12 years as a police officer.<br>
            That job taught me a lot about responsibility, clear communication, and showing up when it counts.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">These days, I'm focused on my family, being active in my church, and helping small businesses succeed.</p>
            <div class="bg-accent/10 border-l-4 border-accent p-4 rounded mb-4">
                <span class="font-semibold text-primary">I believe in doing honest work, keeping my word, and supporting my community</span> — values that have always guided me, whether in uniform or behind a computer.
